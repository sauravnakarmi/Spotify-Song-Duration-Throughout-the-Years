#Overview
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with Amazon Quicksight. Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based business intelligence (BI) tool offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to easily analyze and visualize their data to gain valuable insights. With QuickSight, you can create interactive dashboards, perform ad-hoc analysis, and share insights across your organization. It offers features such as drag-and-drop functionality, integration with various data sources, machine learning-powered insights, and scalability to handle large datasets. Overall, QuickSight simplifies the process of data analysis and empowers users to make data-driven decisions efficiently. For this project I wanted to find out if there was any correlation between the duration of the songs in the top of the year lists provided by spotify and the year that they were popular. In the end, I found that the duration of the songs on average went down as the year progressed. 

## Steps 

# Step 1: Finding Data
I used Kraggle to find the dataset that I would eventually use for this project. I needed a dataset that showed the duration of songs and also the year that they got popular. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephinelsy/spotify-top-hit-playlist-2010-2022)
